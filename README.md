# **House Price Prediction System**

### **Project Overview**
This project implements a **scalable data pipeline** to predict house prices based on historical data. It automates the process of data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, storage, and predictive modeling. The system uses **machine learning** for price prediction and offers a **dynamic dashboard** to visualize the results.

### **Project Description**
The **House Price Prediction System** includes a real-time data pipeline, predictive model, and dynamic dashboard. The system:
- Collects housing data from external sources (like Kaggle datasets or APIs).
- Preprocesses the data for analysis and prediction.
- Stores the data in a cloud-based data warehouse.
- Applies machine learning models (e.g., **Linear Regression** or **XGBoost**) to predict house prices.
- Provides a web-based interface (using **Tableau**, **Power BI**, or **Streamlit**) to visualize predicted prices and trends.

---

### **Tech Stack**
- **Data Ingestion & Orchestration:** Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow
- **Data Processing:** Apache Spark (PySpark), Pandas
- **Data Storage:** AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Linear Regression
- **Visualization & Dashboarding:** Tableau, Power BI, Streamlit
- **Workflow Automation:** Apache Airflow

### **Setup Instructions**
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MOHAMMAD-KAVISH/house-price-prediction.git
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up a cloud-based data warehouse (AWS Redshift, BigQuery, or Snowflake).**  
   - Create a new project and configure credentials for accessing the data warehouse.

4. **Configure Apache Airflow:**
   - Install Apache Airflow and configure DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) to automate data pipeline tasks.

---

### **How It Works**
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Use **Apache Kafka** to stream data in real-time from APIs or external datasets.  
   - Alternatively, use **Airflow** to schedule periodic ingestion tasks.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**  
   - Clean and preprocess data using **Apache Spark** or **Pandas**. This includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Data Storage:**  
   - Store processed data in a cloud-based data warehouse (**AWS Redshift**, **BigQuery**, or **Snowflake**).  
   - Design normalized data schemas for optimized querying.

4. **Predictive Model:**  
   - Use machine learning models (e.g., **XGBoost**, **Linear Regression**) to predict house prices.  
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

5. **Visualization:**  
   - Build an interactive dashboard using **Tableau**, **Power BI**, or **Streamlit** to display insights such as predicted prices, trends, and feature importance.

---

### **Data Flow**
1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   - Data is ingested in real-time (via **Kafka**) or batch (via **Airflow**) from external sources.
   
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**  
   - Data is processed using **Apache Spark** to handle large datasets. **Pandas** is used for smaller datasets and simple transformations.

3. **Machine Learning Pipeline:**  
   - The processed data is split into training and testing datasets, and a machine learning model (e.g., **XGBoost**) is trained to predict house prices.

4. **Model Deployment:**  
   - The trained model is deployed to make real-time predictions when new data is available.

5. **Visualization:**  
   - A dashboard pulls data from the data warehouse and provides real-time insights into house prices, trends, and other relevant metrics.

---

### **Machine Learning Model**
- **Model Used:**  
  - **Linear Regression** or **XGBoost** (for better performance with more complex datasets).  
  - The model is trained to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, neighborhood, and more.

- **Evaluation:**  
  - The model's accuracy is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** or **R-squared**.

---

### **Dashboard & Visualization**
- **Interactive Dashboards:**  
   - **Tableau** or **Power BI** for real-time dashboards.  
   - **Streamlit** is used for building web-based applications, allowing users to interact with the model and input new data for predictions.

- **Key Features on Dashboard:**  
   - Predicted house prices  
   - Historical trends and price fluctuations  
   - Feature importance (showing which factors influence price most)

---

### **Future Improvements**
1. **Real-Time Predictions:**  
   - Implement a more advanced real-time prediction system using **Apache Kafka** and deploy the model to a web server with **Flask** or **FastAPI**.

2. **Model Optimization:**  
   - Experiment with advanced machine learning models like **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**, or **Deep Learning**.

3. **Additional Features:**  
   - Integrate additional external data sources like **weather data**, **local economy trends**, or **real estate market reports** to improve predictions.

4. **Automated Reporting:**  
   - Set up **Apache Airflow** to automate reporting and model re-training based on new data.
